   @book{Belbruno2004,
abstract = {This book describes a revolutionary new approach to determining low energy routes for spacecraft and comets by exploiting regions in space where motion is very sensitive (or chaotic). It also represents an ideal introductory text to celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, and dynamical astronomy. Bringing together wide-ranging research by others with his own original work, much of it new or previously unpublished, Edward Belbruno argues that regions supporting chaotic motions, termed weak stability boundaries, can be estimated. Although controversial until quite recently, this method was in fact first applied in 1991, when Belbruno used a new route developed from this theory to get a stray Japanese satellite back on course to the moon. This application provided a major verification of his theory, representing the first application of chaos to space travel. Since that time, the theory has been used in other space missions, and NASA is implementing new applications under Belbruno's direction. The use of invariant manifolds to find low energy orbits is another method here addressed. Recent work on estimating weak stability boundaries and related regions has also given mathematical insight into chaotic motion in the three-body problem. Belbruno further considers different capture and escape mechanisms, and resonance transitions. Providing a rigorous theoretical framework that incorporates both recent developments such as Aubrey-Mather theory and established fundamentals like Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, this book represents an indispensable resource for graduate students and researchers in the disciplines concerned as well as practitioners in fields such as aerospace engineering.},

@article{Russell2006,
abstract = {A global grid search is performed to find axi- and doubly-symmetric periodic orbits in the restricted three-body problem using the dimensioned parameters associated with the Jupiter-Europa system. Local differential correctors are applied to regions of the initial condition phase space that appear to be near solutions. A three-dimensional initial condition mesh with billions of nodes is evaluated, and over 600,000 periodic solutions are identified. Families of direct and retrograde solutions, both new and previously published, are identified and discussed. Stability is analyzed for each solution and general regions of stability are noted. Of the most promising results is the observation and characterization of a large class of stable yet highly-inclined direct orbits. Finally, all of the solutions and associated properties are archived. The resulting database is a practical reference for preliminary design of missions to Europa.},
