# Periodic Orbit Generator

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of algorithms used to design and propagate a-type periodic orbits about a Lagrangian point.

## Instructions for use

Clone the repository to any directory on your system, then run MATLAB on the orbitGenerator() function in the main directory.
