Firstly, this work would not be possible without the hard efforts of my Supervisor, Dr. Hodei Urrutxua, who decided to take on the first-year who landed in his email inbox one day. I wish to thank Dr. Urrutxua for all the professional and personal development he has afforded me, both in the field of Manifold Dynamics and outside of it.

Similarly, I wish to thank ... and Dr. Hugh Lewis for their assistance in seeing me through my years at University, and for allowing me to extend the scope and complexity of this piece.

In a similar vein, I wish to thank Miss India Yardley for the previous three years of happy times -- for being there no matter the situation, and making sure I always perform to my best.

And lastly, to Gibson: woof woof, woof. Good boy.
